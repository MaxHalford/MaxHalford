## Hello there, I'm [Max](https://maxhalford.github.io/bio) 👋

I'm a Staff Data Scientist at [Carbonfact](https://www.carbonfact.com/). We do data science to measure and reduce the environmental footprint of clothing brands.

I co-lead [The Fellowship of Online Machine Learning](https://www.notion.so/maxhalford/The-Fellowship-of-Online-Machine-Learning-8a264829ccf345a4b2627de38139ec8b?pvs=4), which is a group of people who enjoy researching and implementing online algorithms. In particular, we develop and maintain [River](https://riverml.xyz/0.19.0/).
