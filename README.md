## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Max](https://maxhalford.github.io/bio), a data scientist working in the climate industry at [Carbonfact](https://www.carbonfact.com/).

I lead [The Fellowship of Online Machine Learning](https://www.notion.so/maxhalford/The-Fellowship-of-Online-Machine-Learning-8a264829ccf345a4b2627de38139ec8b?pvs=4), which is a group of people who enjoy processing streaming data. In particular, we develop and maintain [River](https://riverml.xyz/0.19.0/).

I teach data science to graduate students at the Toulouse School of Economics. You can find the course contents [here](https://maxhalford.notion.site/Teaching-41247061b73349c8b22888a6218108a3?pvs=4).
